    This means putting your finger and your thumb at the very back of the knife and wrapping your fingers around the handle. It gives you a firm grip and more control when you’re chopping.<br>
    When you actually start chopping, don’t lay all of your fingers flat. It puts them in danger of getting cut.<br>
    <strong>Rather, form a claw with your fingers so your fingertips will  be protected the whole time.
        <u>Plus, it’ll give you support as you’re chopping</u></strong><br>A common mistake is using the slicing motion and chopping down aggressively on the cutting board. 
        To get an even cut, you want to use a rocking motion, going back and forth with the knife.<br>
